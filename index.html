                    <p class="bold">The English Market</p><p class="info">The English Market has been around since 1788. Far from being English (it’s named for its Protestant origins), this is the place to pick up traditional specialities like drisheen and pigs’ trotters, although the 55 or so stalls also stock bread, fish, cheese and fruit and veg. The market has survived fire, civil war and an attempted name change, but it took a failed bid to replace it with a car park in the 1980s for the people of Cork to realise that their culinary capital was worth saving! </p>

                    <p class="bold">Cork City Gaol</p><p class="info">A mixture of grand Gothic and classical architecture, Cork City Gaol looks more like a castle than a penitentiary. But don't be fooled – these elegant walls have enclosed some of the most battle-hardened veterans of armed struggle. This was chiefly a women’s prison, where many republican women were held during the War of Independence. Take a tour through the gloomy cells and corridors to be transported back to those tough and turbulent times</p>

                    <p class="bold">Franciscan Well Brewery</p><p class="info">The weight of Cork's lengthy history adds a certain richness to this city, not least of all to its strong tradition of brewing, reinvigorated today at the Franciscan Well. The brewery is named after the site itself, where a medieval Franciscan monastery once stood – complete with a healing well. While the beer brewed onsite today may not technically have curative powers, it’s still pretty good! Relax with a pint in the beer garden, where tunes from local musicians often fill the rafters.</p>
